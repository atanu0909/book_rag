    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes 
    code readability with its use of significant whitespace.
    
    Key features of Python include:
    - Simple and easy to learn syntax
    - Interpreted language
    - Object-oriented programming support
    - Large standard library
    - Cross-platform compatibility
    
    Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, 
    and many other fields. Its versatility and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it an excellent 
    choice for beginners and experts alike.
